// Clsx is a simple JavaScript utility for conditionally joining classes together.
// It makes our lives easier by giving us syntactic sugar to handle complex styles for CSS solutions like CSS modules, or Tailwind CSS.
//ðŸ’¡ This library is the same as Classnames but has a smaller bundle size and better performance.
